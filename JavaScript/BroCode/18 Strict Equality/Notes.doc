🧩 1️⃣ = → Assignment Operator

    It is used to assign a value to a variable.
    It does not compare, it just stores the value.

Example:
    let x = 5;  // assigns 5 to x

    🧠 Means: “Hey JavaScript, keep 5 inside the box named x.”

💡 Real-life Example:

    Like putting ₹5 in a piggy bank 🐷 —
    You’re storing money inside, not checking anything.

🧩 2️⃣ == → Loose Equality (Normal Equality)

    It compares values only, not types.
    If the types are different, JavaScript will try to convert them before comparing.

Example:
    console.log(5 == "5");   // true (same value after conversion)
    console.log(true == 1);  // true (true becomes 1)

💡 Real-life Example:

    Like comparing “5 rupees coin” and “₹5 note” —
    Different form, but same value. So JavaScript says “Okay, true!”

🧩 3️⃣ === → Strict Equality

    It checks both value and type.
    If either one is different → false.

Example:
    console.log(5 === "5");   // false (number vs string)
    console.log(5 === 5);     // true

💡 Real-life Example:

    Like checking your original key vs a photo of your key.
    Looks same, but not same type — can’t open the door!

🧩 4️⃣ != → Loose Inequality

    It checks if values are not equal (after type conversion).

Example:
    console.log(5 != "5");  // false (same value after conversion)
    console.log(5 != 6);    // true

💡 Real-life Example:

    Comparing two ₹5 coins — same value, so not unequal (false).

🧩 5️⃣ !== → Strict Inequality

    It checks if value or type are not equal (without conversion).

Example:
    console.log(5 !== "5");  // true (different type)
    console.log(5 !== 5);    // false (same value and type)

💡 Real-life Example:

    Like comparing metal key and photo key again —
    They are not same type, so “not equal” (true).
