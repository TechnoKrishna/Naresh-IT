😊 Constants

In JavaScript, a constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is given.

We create a constant using the keyword const.

So once you give a value to a constant, you cannot reassign or change it later in the program.

🧩 Syntax:

const PI = 3.14;

Here:
    const → means it’s a constant.
    PI → name of the constant.
    3.14 → value that cannot change.

⚠️ Example (what you cannot do):

const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.1415; // ❌ Error! You can’t change the value of a constant.

This will give an error because constants are read-only once created.
