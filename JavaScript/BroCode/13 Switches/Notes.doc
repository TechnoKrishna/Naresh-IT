🧠 switch statement

A switch statement is used when you have many possible conditions to check for one value.
It’s like an alternative to using many if...else if...else statements.

👉 It checks a value and compares it with multiple cases.
If it matches one case, that block of code runs.

🧩 Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to run if expression === value1
    break;

  case value2:
    // code to run if expression === value2
    break;

  default:
    // code to run if no case matches
}

The break keyword stops the switch after finding the matching case.
The default case runs when nothing matches.

💡 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you run a juice shop, and a customer orders a drink.
You want to make the juice based on what they choose.

let order = "mango";

switch (order) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("You ordered Apple Juice 🍎");
    break;

  case "mango":
    console.log("You ordered Mango Juice 🥭");
    break;

  case "orange":
    console.log("You ordered Orange Juice 🍊");
    break;

  default:
    console.log("Sorry, we don’t have that juice 😞");
}

🧾 Output:
You ordered Mango Juice 🥭

Because the value of order is "mango", it matches the second case, so that block runs.

⚙️ Without break (for understanding):

If you forget to write break, it will continue running the next cases too —
This is called fall-through behavior.
