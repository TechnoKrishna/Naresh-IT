🧠 What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return either true or false based on the result.

There are 3 main logical operators in JavaScript 👇

🧩 1. Logical AND (&&)

    ✅ Condition: Returns true if both statements are true.
    ❌ If even one is false, result is false.

Example in code:

    let age = 20;
    let hasID = true;

    if (age >= 18 && hasID) {
      console.log("You are allowed to enter the club.");
    } else {
      console.log("Entry denied.");
    }

Explanation:

    Both conditions (age >= 18 and hasID == true) must be true.
    If you’re 20 and have your ID, you can enter.
    If you forget your ID or are underage, entry is denied.

🎯 Real-life example:

    Imagine a club bouncer — you can enter only if you are an adult AND you have your ID.

🧩 2. Logical OR (||)

    ✅ Condition: Returns true if at least one condition is true.
    ❌ Returns false only if both are false.

Example in code:

    let hasTicket = false;
    let isGuest = true;

    if (hasTicket || isGuest) {
      console.log("You can enter the show.");
    } else {
      console.log("You cannot enter.");
    }

Explanation:

    If you have a ticket or you are a guest, you can enter.
    If you have neither, you can’t.

🎯 Real-life example:
    You can enter a movie either if you buy a ticket OR you are on the VIP guest list.

🧩 3. Logical NOT (!)

    ✅ Condition: It simply reverses the result.
    If condition is true → becomes false
    If condition is false → becomes true

Example in code:

    let isRaining = false;

    if (!isRaining) {
      console.log("Let’s go for a walk!");
    } else {
      console.log("Stay home, it's raining.");
    }

Explanation:

    !isRaining becomes !false → which is true.
    So it prints “Let’s go for a walk!”

🎯 Real-life example:

    You want to go outside only if it’s not raining.
    So you check the opposite condition — “NOT raining”.
