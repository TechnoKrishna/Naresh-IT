A while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}

The condition is checked before each iteration.
If the condition is true → code runs.
If the condition is false → loop stops.

Real-Life Example

Imagine you are eating slices of pizza.

You have 5 slices.

You decide: “I will eat one slice at a time while slices are remaining.”

Code Example:

let slices = 5;

while (slices > 0) {
    console.log("I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: " + slices);
    slices--; // eat one slice
}

console.log("No pizza left! 🍕");

I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: 5
I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: 4
I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: 3
I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: 2
I ate a slice of pizza. Slices left: 1
No pizza left! 🍕

Explanation of Code:

slices > 0 is the condition.
slices-- reduces one slice each time.
Loop stops when slices becomes 0.
