In JavaScript, to generate a random number, we use:

Math.random()

This function gives a random decimal number between 0 (included) and 1 (excluded) —
that means something like 0.25, 0.78, 0.999, etc.

⚙️ Example:
let randomNum = Math.random();
console.log(randomNum);

This will print a random number like 0.345678 every time you run it.

🎯 If you want a random number between 1 and 10:

We can multiply and round it.

let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log(randomNum);

👉 Math.floor() removes decimal points
👉 *10 makes range 0–9
👉 +1 makes range 1–10

So you’ll get random numbers like: 3, 8, 5, 1, etc.

🌍 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you’re rolling a dice 🎲.
Each time you roll it, you get a random number between 1 and 6.

You can create that in JavaScript like this:

let dice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
console.log("You got: " + dice);

Every time you run it, you get a new random result like
“You got: 4” or “You got: 2”.
