ðŸ§  Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a short way to write an if...else statement.

ðŸ‘‰ It has three parts (thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called ternary):

    condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

    If the condition is true â†’ it runs value_if_true
    If the condition is false â†’ it runs value_if_false

ðŸ’» Example in JavaScript:

    let age = 20;
    let result = (age >= 18) ? "You can vote" : "You cannot vote";
    console.log(result);

Explanation:

    age >= 18 â†’ this is the condition
    If true â†’ it gives "You can vote"
    If false â†’ it gives "You cannot vote"

Here, age is 20, which is greater than 18 â†’ so output will be:

    You can vote
