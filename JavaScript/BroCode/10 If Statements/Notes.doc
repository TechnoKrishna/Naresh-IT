An if statement in JavaScript is used to check a condition.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the if block runs.
If it’s false, then the code is skipped.

🧩 Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // code to run if condition is true
}

✅ Example:
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote!");
}

Explanation:

    The condition age >= 18 is checked.
    Since age is 20, the condition is true.
    So the message "You can vote!" is printed on the screen.

🌍 Real-Life Example:

Think of it like this —
When you go to a movie theater 🎬:

If your age is 18 or above, you are allowed to watch an “A-rated” movie.
If not, you can’t watch it.
The “if” is like the guard checking your age at the entry.

🟢 1️⃣ if...else Statement

The if...else statement is used when you want to do one thing if the condition is true, and another thing if it’s false.

🧩 Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // runs if condition is true
} else {
  // runs if condition is false
}

✅ Example:
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote!");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot vote yet.");
}

Explanation:

The condition age >= 18 is false because age = 16.
So, the code inside else runs → it prints "You cannot vote yet."

🟠 2️⃣ if...else if...else Statement

This is used when you have multiple conditions to check — not just true or false.
You test them one by one until one of them becomes true.

🧩 Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  // runs if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // runs if condition2 is true
} else {
  // runs if none of the above conditions are true
}

✅ Example:
let marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade A+");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade A");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
  console.log("Grade B");
} else {
  console.log("Fail");
}


Explanation:

The first condition (marks >= 90) → false

The second condition (marks >= 75) → true
✅ So it prints “Grade A” and stops checking further.
