Variable Scope means where your variable can be accessed (used) in your code.

In JavaScript, there are three main types of scope:

a > Global Scope – Accessible anywhere in the program.
b > Function Scope – Accessible only inside the function where it is declared.
c > Block Scope – Accessible only inside the block {} where it is declared (like inside if, for, or while).

💡 Example Code:
let globalVar = "I am Global"; // Global Scope

function myFunction() {
  let functionVar = "I am inside the function"; // Function Scope

  if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I am inside a block"; // Block Scope
    console.log(blockVar); // ✅ works here
  }

  console.log(functionVar); // ✅ works here
  // console.log(blockVar); ❌ error, blockVar not accessible here
}

myFunction();

console.log(globalVar); // ✅ works anywhere
// console.log(functionVar); ❌ error, not accessible outside function

🏠 Real-Life Example:

Imagine your school as a JavaScript program.

The school playground is like the Global Scope — everyone in the school can go there.

The classroom is like a Function Scope — only students of that class can enter.

The desk drawer inside the classroom is like a Block Scope — only the student sitting at that desk can open it.

So:

Playground (Global) = accessible by everyone.

Classroom (Function) = accessible only by students inside.

Desk Drawer (Block) = accessible only by that one student.
