🧠 What is Checked Property?

In JavaScript, the checked property is used to check whether a checkbox or radio button is selected or not.

It tells us:

    ✅ true → if it is checked

    ❌ false → if it is not checked

🧩 Simple Syntax

    document.getElementById("myCheckbox").checked

    This line will return true if the checkbox is checked.
    It will return false if the checkbox is not checked.

💡 Real-life Example

Imagine you are filling out an online form that asks:

    “Do you agree to the terms and conditions?” 
    (and there’s a checkbox beside it)

When you click the Submit button, the website checks if you have ticked that box or not.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="agreeBox"> I agree to the terms and conditions
</label>
<br><br>

<button onclick="checkAgreement()">Submit</button>

<script>
function checkAgreement() {
  let isChecked = document.getElementById("agreeBox").checked;

  if (isChecked) {
    alert("✅ You agreed to the terms!");
  } else {
    alert("❌ Please agree to the terms before continuing!");
  }
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

🧾 Explanation in Simple Words

    When you click the “Submit” button, the function checkAgreement() runs.
    It checks if the checkbox (agreeBox) is ticked or not using .checked.
    Based on that, it shows an alert message.

🚗 Real-Life Example

    Think of it like a car key switch:
    When the key is turned ON → the car starts (checked = true)
    When the key is OFF → the car doesn’t start (checked = false)
    Similarly, .checked tells us whether the switch (checkbox) is ON or OFF ✅❌
