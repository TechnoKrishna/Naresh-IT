1 > Client-Server Architecture

| **Component**     | **Description**                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Client**        | The system or application where the user runs queries or commands (example: SQL*Plus, application software).             |
| **Server**        | The system where the Oracle Database is installed and stored. It processes the client’s requests and sends results back. |
| **Communication** | The client sends a request (SQL query) to the server → the server executes it → and sends the result back to the client. |

🧠 In Simple Words:

    Client = person who asks a question.
    Server = the one who gives the answer after searching in the database.

💡 Real-life Example:

Think of an online food ordering app:

    You (user) → Client
    Swiggy’s main system (that stores all restaurant data) → Server
    You request “Show pizza restaurants” → Server finds and returns results.


2 > Working with Oracle Database Server

When you want to work with an Oracle Database, you must follow two main steps:

    1️⃣ Connect

    Establish a connection between your client (SQL*Plus or application) and the Oracle database server.

    2️⃣ Communicate

    Once connected, you can send SQL commands (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and get results from the server.

💡 Example:

    SQL> CONNECT system/password;
    SQL> SELECT * FROM employees;

Here:

    First line = connect
    Second line = communicate

3 > Difference Between SQL*Plus and SQL (Tabular Format)

| **Basis**        | **SQL**                                                                           | **SQL*Plus**                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query and manage data in the database. | SQL*Plus is a command-line tool used to interact with the Oracle database.     |
| **Type**         | It’s a **language**.                                                              | It’s a **tool / interface**.                                                   |
| **Purpose**      | To perform operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc.           | To connect, execute SQL commands, create scripts, and control the environment. |
| **Output**       | Returns data or messages after executing SQL commands.                            | Displays SQL results and allows formatting, scripting, and saving outputs.     |
| **Example**      | `SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;`                                                         | `SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;` (inside SQL*Plus environment)                   |
| **Availability** | Used in many tools (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server).                                   | Specific to Oracle Database.                                                   |

In Short:

    SQL → Language
    SQL*Plus → Tool to use that language in Oracle.

4 > How to Connect to Oracle Server

Using Username and Password

    SQL> CONNECT username/password;

💡 Example:

    SQL> CONNECT system/oracle;

    system → username
    oracle → password
