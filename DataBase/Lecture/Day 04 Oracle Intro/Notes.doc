🧩 1️⃣ Introduction to Oracle

Oracle is a Database Management System (DBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation.
It helps to store, manage, and retrieve data in an organized way using SQL (Structured Query Language).

When the amount of data becomes very large (like for banks, hospitals, or online stores), simple file systems cannot handle it efficiently — so Oracle DBMS is used.

In short:
Oracle = A powerful tool that helps to handle large amounts of data safely and quickly.

Real-Life Example:

Imagine a bank that stores customer details, account numbers, transactions, and loan records.

If millions of people use the bank, Oracle manages all that data so that when you check your balance or transfer money, the result comes within seconds — securely and correctly.


🖥️ 2️⃣ What is Platform?

A platform means the environment or system on which a program runs — like Windows, macOS, Linux, or Android.

Every software needs a platform to work.

🧠 Types of Platform:

(1) Platform Dependent

If a program runs only on a specific operating system, it is called platform dependent.

C language is platform dependent because if you compile a C program on Windows, the compiled .exe file will not run on Linux or macOS.

Real-Life Example:
Think of a mobile charger that fits only one type of phone.
If you switch phones, you’ll need a new charger.
That’s platform dependent.


(2) Platform Independent

If a program can run on any operating system, it is called platform independent.

Java is platform independent because once you write and compile a Java program, it can run on Windows, Linux, or macOS without any changes (using JVM – Java Virtual Machine).

Real-Life Example:
Think of a USB charger that works with any phone — Samsung, iPhone, Vivo, etc.
No need to change it — that’s platform independent.
