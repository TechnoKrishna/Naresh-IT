1️⃣ What is DBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) is software used to store, organize, and manage data easily.

It helps users to add, update, delete, and retrieve data efficiently without worrying about how it’s stored internally.

🔹 Real-life Example:

Think of a library.

    The bookshelves are like tables.
    Each book is like a record.
    The librarian is like the DBMS — she helps you find, add, or remove a book without you going through every shelf yourself.

So, DBMS acts like a smart librarian for your data!

2️⃣ Models of DBMS

These are the different ways data can be stored and connected inside a database.

1) Hierarchical Database Model

In this model, data is stored in a tree-like structure (like a family tree).

Each parent record can have many child records, but each child can have only one parent.

🔹 Real-life Example:

Think about a company structure:

    The CEO is at the top (root).
    Below are managers (child nodes).
    Under each manager, there are employees (sub-children).

It’s like a tree of hierarchy — one parent can have many children, but each child has only one parent.

2) Network Database Model

In this model, data is stored in a network form where one record can have multiple parents and multiple children.

It’s more flexible than the hierarchical model.

🔹 Real-life Example:

Imagine a college system:

    A student can enroll in multiple courses, and
    Each course can have many students.

So, there’s a many-to-many relationship — this is what the network model supports.

3) Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

In this model, data is stored in tables (rows and columns).

Each table represents an entity (like Students, Employees, Products, etc.), and we can link tables using keys.

🔹 Real-life Example:

Think about a bank database:

    One table stores Customer details (Customer ID, Name, Address).
    Another table stores Account details (Account No, Balance, Customer ID).

Here, Customer ID acts as a link (key) between both tables.
This makes it easy to find which account belongs to which customer.

🔸 (i) ORDBMS – Object-Relational DBMS

It’s a combination of Object-Oriented and Relational models.

It allows us to store objects (like images, videos, or complex data) along with relational data (tables).

🔹 Real-life Example:

In a social media app,

    You can store user info (name, email) in a table (relational part).
    You can also store profile picture or videos (object part).

So, ORDBMS = RDBMS + Object features.

🔸 (ii) OODBMS – Object-Oriented DBMS

In this model, data is stored in the form of objects, just like in object-oriented programming (OOP).

Objects contain both data and methods (functions that work on data).

🔹 Real-life Example:

Think of a video game:

Each character is an object having properties like name, health, power, and methods like attack() or jump().

In an OODBMS, you can directly store these objects without converting them into tables.
