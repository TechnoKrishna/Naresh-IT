🔹 Data:

    Data means raw facts or figures — it has no clear meaning until it’s processed or organized.

    It can be numbers, text, or symbols.

    Example:
    101, Krishna, 85, A+

    These are just pieces of data. Alone, they don’t tell us much.

🔹 Information:

    Information means processed or organized data that gives meaning or helps in decision-making.

    Example:
    “Roll No 101 — Krishna scored 85 marks and got A+ grade.”

    Now this statement gives meaningful knowledge, so it’s information.

🏫 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you’re a teacher.

    You collect students’ marks: 85, 90, 78, 92. → This is data.

    When you calculate the average marks, find the topper, and print a report card, that becomes information.

So,
📊 Data = Raw input
💡 Information = Processed output


🔹 what is database?

    A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated using a computer.

    It helps to store data in a structured way so that you can find and use it quickly whenever needed.

💡 Simple Explanation:

    Think of a database as a digital cupboard where all your data is neatly stored in shelves (tables).
    Each shelf has small boxes (rows and columns) that hold related information.


🏦 Real-Life Example:

Imagine a school 🏫:

    The school needs to keep records of students — their names, roll numbers, grades, phone numbers, etc.

    If the school writes everything in a notebook, it’s hard to find or update details later.

    So instead, they use a database on a computer.

    Inside the database:

    One table stores student details
    Another table stores teacher details
    Another table stores subjects and marks

    This makes searching and managing data fast and easy.
