✅ 1. Aggregation (Weak Association)

Easy Definition

Aggregation means one class has another class, but the two can live independently.

College exists even without Student
Student exists even without College

➡️ Relationship: HAS-A (but weak)
➡️ Destroying parent object does NOT destroy child object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✔ Your Program Explanation

College clg = new College("VIT", "Vellore");
clg = new College("NIT", "Hyderabad");

First, you created a College object (VIT)
Then you reassigned clg to new College (NIT)
Old object is no longer referenced (eligible for GC)

Student s1 = new Student(1, "Scott", "Hyd", clg);
Student s2 = new Student(2, "Smith", "Ampt", clg);

Both students refer to the same college object.

➡️ This is aggregation because:

Even if s1 or s2 object is destroyed, College still exists.

Even if College object is destroyed, student object can still continue to exist (but their college would be null or different).

🟦 Real-Life Example of Aggregation

Think of:

Student HAS-A College

But:

If student leaves the college → college still exists
If college shuts down → student still exists as a person

So it's NOT tightly connected → Weak relationship.

Another real example:

Car HAS-A Music Player
But:

Music player can exist outside the car
Car can exist without a music player

So this is aggregation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 2. Why System.out.println() is Aggregation

Inside System class:

public static final java.io.PrintStream out = null;

So,
System HAS-A PrintStream
This is exactly aggregation.

When you call:

System.out.println("Hello");

Meaning:
“Use the PrintStream stored inside System to print text”

➡️ System object and PrintStream object both exist independently
➡️ Destroying one does not destroy the other

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✔ Your Test Example

public static final String out;

static {
    out = new String("India");
}

This is showing that System.out is just a reference to another object.
It is aggregation (HAS-A relation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 3. String Handling in Java

✔ Strings are stored as Character Arrays

Example:

String str = "Raj";

Internally:

| Index | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0     | R     |
| 1     | a     |
| 2     | j     |

So a string is basically a char array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 4. Ways to Create Strings in Java

1️⃣ Using String Literal (most common)

String x = "Ravi";

Stored inside String Constant Pool (SCP).

2️⃣ Using new keyword

String y = new String("Hyderabad");

Stored in Heap memory, AND literal “Hyderabad” also placed in SCP.

(Total 2 objects created)

3️⃣ From character array

char z[] = {'H','E','L','L','O'};
String s = new String(z);

Old method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 5. What is Immutability?

String objects cannot be changed once created.

If you modify a string:

String s = "India";
s.toUpperCase(); // INDIA

A new object is created.

❌ Original string never changes

✅ New string is created

🟦 Real-Life Example of Immutability

Think of a sealed envelope.
Once you write a letter and seal it → you can't change the letter inside
If you want to modify the content → you write a new letter
String works like this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 6. Understanding SCP (String Constant Pool)

✔ When you create:

String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";
String s3 = "Java";

JVM checks SCP:

“Java” already exists → don’t create new
So all variables point to the same object

s1 → “Java” (1000x)
s2 → “Java” (1000x)
s3 → “Java” (1000x)

➡️ SCP does not allow duplicate string objects.

🟦 Real-Life Example of SCP

Think of a common WhatsApp group photo.
The group photo exists only once.
Every member (reference variable) is just pointing to the same photo.
We don’t store multiple copies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ 7. intern() Method Explained

intern() forces a string to be placed in the SCP.

String s1 = new String("India");
String s2 = s1.intern();
String s3 = "India";

Here:

s1 is in heap
s2 goes to SCP
s3 also refers to SCP copy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now:

s2 == s3 → true
s1 == s2 → false

🟦 Real-Life Example of intern()

Think intern() like saying:

“Store this name officially in Aadhaar Database so others use the same one.”

Heap string: temporary name
SCP string: official Aadhaar record

Everyone refers to the official one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔥 NOW LET'S SUMMARIZE EVERYTHING SUPER-EASILY 🔥

✔ Aggregation

HAS-A (weak)
Both objects can survive independently
Student–College, Car–MusicPlayer

✔ System.out.println()

System class HAS-A PrintStream object
This is aggregation

✔ String Creation Methods

Literal
new keyword
char array

✔ Immutability

Strings cannot be changed
New object is created for every modification

✔ SCP (String Constant Pool)

Stores all literal strings
Prevents duplicate strings
Saves memory

✔ intern()

Moves string to SCP
Ensures same object reference for same content

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X - X -X - X
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ HEAP vs SCP (String Constant Pool)


✅ 1. HEAP MEMORY
✔ What is it?

The general memory area where all Java objects are stored.
Strings created using new keyword always go here.
Allows duplicate string objects.
Objects here are eligible for Garbage Collection.

✔ How string goes to Heap?

String s1 = new String("India");


Memory:

HEAP:
   [2000x] → "India"   (object)


Also, SCP will contain the literal "India" (if not already present).

🟦 REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE of HEAP

Heap is like a big warehouse where you can store unlimited items.
No rules — duplicates allowed.
You can have:

    10 shirts of same color
    5 identical chairs

Same way, Heap allows duplicate objects.

✅ 2. SCP (String Constant Pool)

✔ What is it?
A special memory area inside Heap ONLY for string literals.
No duplicates allowed.
Highly optimized.
Faster to access.

✔ How string goes to SCP?
String s1 = "India";   // literal → SCP
String s2 = "India";   // refers to same SCP object


Memory:

SCP:
  [1000x] → "India"
  
s1 → 1000x  
s2 → 1000x

➡️ Only one copy exists.

🟦 REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE of SCP

Think of SCP like a public notice board.

    If someone already posted a notice “Meeting at 5PM
    You don’t add another same notice
    You just point to the existing notice

Same way:

    “India” literal exists once in SCP
    All variables point to same object

🧠 3. Why JVM Created SCP?

Because string operations happen frequently.

So JVM decided to:

    Prevent duplicates
    Save memory
    Improve performance
    Make string comparison faster (== works in some cases)

🌟 4. Diagrams: Heap vs SCP

Case 1: Literal String

String a = "Java";
String b = "Java";

Memory Diagram:

        SCP
   ----------------
   "Java" [1000x]
   ----------------
     ↑       ↑
     |       |
     a       b

        HEAP
   ----------------
   (empty or other objects)
   ----------------

Both a and b refer to the same SCP object.


Case 2: new Keyword

String x = new String("Java");
String y = new String("Java");

Memory Diagram:

        SCP
   ----------------
   "Java" [1000x]
   ----------------

        HEAP
   ----------------
   "Java" [2000x]
   "Java" [3000x]
   ----------------

x → 2000x  
y → 3000x

Here:

    1 literal in SCP
    2 different objects in Heap

Case 3: Literal + new mix

String s1 = "India";
String s2 = new String("India");

Memory Diagram:

        SCP
   ----------------
   "India" [1000x]
   ----------------
     ↑
     |
    s1

        HEAP
   ----------------
   "India" [2000x]
   ----------------
          ↑
          |
          s2


s1 == s2 → false
(s1 → SCP, s2 → Heap)


🔥 5. intern() and Heap → SCP Conversion

String s1 = new String("Hyd");
String s2 = s1.intern();
String s3 = "Hyd";


Memory:

        SCP
   ----------------
   "Hyd" [1000x]
   ----------------
      ↑      ↑
      |      |
     s2     s3

        HEAP
   ----------------
   "Hyd" [2000x]
   ----------------
      ↑
      |
     s1

s2 == s3 → true
s1 == s2 → false

| Feature    | **Heap Memory**            | **SCP (String Constant Pool)**          |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Storage    | All objects                | Only string literals                    |
| Duplicates | Allowed                    | NOT allowed                             |

| Memory use | Large                      | Small & optimized                       |
| GC         | Yes                        | Yes (but rarely)                        |
| Creation   | new keyword                | String literals or intern()             |
| Location   | Heap area                  | Special area inside Heap                |
| Comparison | == works only by reference | == often works because object is shared |

🌟 7. Easiest Summary

Literal strings → go to SCP
new String() objects → go to Heap
SCP: No duplicates, fast, memory efficient
Heap: Normal memory, duplicates allowed
Strings are immutable → every change creates a new object
intern() → pushes a string into SCP
