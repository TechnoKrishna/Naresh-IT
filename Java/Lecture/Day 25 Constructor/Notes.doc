Complete Variable History Explained

1. Class Variable / Static Field

Declaration Position

    Declared inside a class but outside any method
    Example: class Car { static int wheels = 4; }

Scope

    Belongs to the class itself, not to any object
    Example: Car.wheels can be accessed without creating a Car object

Memory Area

    Stored in the Method Area (part of JVM memory for class-level info)
    Example: JVM keeps wheels in Method Area

Applicable Modifiers

    Can use: private, protected, public, final, transient, volatile
    Example: public static final int wheels = 4;

Accessed By

    Can be accessed using Class name or object reference
    Example: Car.wheels or new Car().wheels

Lifetime

    Exists throughout the program execution until the class is unloaded
    Example: Always available while program runs

Real-life example:

    Imagine a school. totalStudents in the school is same for all classes. You don’t need a separate counter for each classroom—this is like a static field.

2. Instance Variable / Non-Static Field

Declaration Position

    Declared inside class, but outside methods
    Example: class Car { int speed; }

Scope

    Belongs to a specific object. Each object has its own copy
    Example:
    Car c1 = new Car(); c1.speed = 50;
    Car c2 = new Car(); c2.speed = 100;

Memory Area

    Stored in the Heap Area (object memory)
    Example: c1 and c2 speed values stored in Heap

Applicable Modifiers

    Can use: private, default, protected, public, final, transient, volatile
    Example: private int speed;

Accessed By

    Accessed using object reference only
    Example: c1.speed or c2.speed

Lifetime

    Lives as long as the object exists
    Example: When the object is deleted, memory is freed

Real-life example:

    Think of students in a school. Each student has their own name and roll number. These are instance variables—they belong to the individual, not the whole school.

3. Local Variable

Declaration Position

    Declared inside a method, block, or constructor
    Example: void startCar() { int temp = 20; }

Scope

    Only accessible inside that method, block, or constructor
    Example: temp cannot be accessed outside startCar()

Memory Area

    Stored in the Stack Area (memory for method execution)
    Example: Once the method ends, temp is removed from memory

Applicable Modifiers

    Only final is allowed
    Example: final int temp = 20;

Accessed By

    Only inside the method/block where it is declared
    Example: Cannot use outside method

Lifetime

    Exists until the method/block finishes execution
    Example: When the method ends, local variables are gone

Real-life example:

    Think of a recipe step in cooking. If step says “Add 2 spoons of sugar,” the sugar measurement is only relevant during that step. After you finish, it doesn’t matter anymore—like a local variable.

4. Parameter Variable

Declaration Position

    Declared inside method parentheses
    Example: void setSpeed(int s) { speed = s; }

Scope

    Only exists while method is executing
    Example: s is only known inside setSpeed() method

Memory Area

    Stored in the Stack Area (like local variables)
    Example: When the method finishes, the parameter variable disappears

Applicable Modifiers

    Only final is allowed
    Example: void setSpeed(final int s)

Accessed By

    Passed when calling the method
    Example: car.setSpeed(50);

Lifetime

    Exists until method ends execution
    Example: After method finishes, s is gone

Real-life example:

    Think of a delivery address you give to a courier. The address is only used while delivering. Once delivery is done, the address is no longer needed.

Invalid Modifiers

    Not Allowed Modifiers

        abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, final + volatile

    Why Not Allowed

        These modifiers don’t make sense for class-level static variables

Non-Static Field – Invalid Modifiers

    Not Allowed Modifiers

        abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp

    Why Not Allowed

        These are meant for methods, not object (instance) variables

Local Variable – Invalid Modifiers

    Not Allowed Modifiers

        Anything except final

    Why Not Allowed

        Local variables live temporarily during method execution; other modifiers are meaningless

Parameter Variable – Invalid Modifiers

    Not Allowed Modifiers

        Anything except final

    Why Not Allowed

        Parameters are temporary and cannot have other modifiers

✅ Summary in One Line Each

Static/Class Variable: One copy per class, exists always.
Instance Variable: One copy per object, exists as long as object exists.
Local Variable: Temporary, exists only inside method/block.
Parameter Variable: Temporary, used only inside method, passed from outside

1. What is a Constructor?

    A constructor is a special method in a class used to create and initialize objects.

    It is called automatically when you create an object using new.

    That’s why it is also called an object builder.

Real-life example:

    Think of a car factory. When you order a car, the factory constructs the car and sets its initial color, engine type, etc. That’s like a constructor setting default or user-defined values for an object.

2. Why use a Constructor?

    To initialize the object at the time of creation.

    Saves the extra step of calling setter methods to assign values.

Example without constructor:

public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Employee() { }  // Default constructor

    public void set(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Employee emp = new Employee();  // Object created, variables get default values
emp.set(111, "Raj");           // Variables re-initialized with user values

Explanation:

    emp is created → id and name are initialized to default values (0 and null).
    set() method is called → values are re-initialized to user-defined values (111 and "Raj").

Real-life example:

    You get a plain cake from the bakery (default values).
    Then you add chocolate and toppings yourself (user-defined values).

3. Key Points about Constructors

    If you don’t write a constructor, the compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor.
    All non-static fields are initialized with default values using new.
    Constructor is automatically invoked when an object is created.

4. User-defined Constructor

    You can define your own constructor to initialize values during object creation.

Example:

public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Raj"); // Initialization happens in the same line


Explanation:

    Here, default initialization + user initialization happens at object creation.
    You don’t need a separate set() method.

Real-life example:

    Ordering a customized car where the factory sets color, model, and engine type immediately. You don’t modify it later.

5. Definition of Constructor

Rules:

    Class name = Constructor name
    No return type (not even void)
    Main purpose → Initialize non-static fields

Example of rule violation:

public void Student() { // This is a method, not a constructor
    System.out.println("I am Method");
}


    Although it looks like a constructor, it has void → it’s a method.

Correct constructor example:

public Student() {
    System.out.println("I am Constructor");
    return; // Valid, no value
}


Explanation:

    Constructor can use return; without any value, but cannot return any data.
    Called automatically when object is created.

Real-life example:

    Think of assembling a chair. Once you order it (create object), the factory assembles it automatically. You don’t need to call it manually.

6. Important Rules of Constructor

    Rule: Every class must have at least one constructor
    Explanation: Compiler adds a default constructor if none is written

    Rule: Constructor invoked automatically
    Explanation: Called every time you create an object using new

    Rule: No return type
    Explanation: Constructor cannot return any data, not even void


✅ Summary in Simple Words

    Constructor = special method to build objects.
    Default constructor → provided by compiler automatically.
    User-defined constructor → initialize with custom values during object creation.
    Automatically called → you don’t have to call it manually.
    Rules → same name as class, no return type, at least one constructor per class.


Types of Constructors in Java

    In Java, constructors are used to initialize objects. There are 3 main types:
    1 > Default No-Argument Constructor (added by compiler)
    2 > No-Argument Constructor (written by user)
    3 > Parameterized Constructor

    We’ll go one by one.

1️⃣ Default No-Argument Constructor

What is it?

    Automatically added by compiler if no constructor is written.
    No parameters accepted.
    Access modifier = same as class.

Purpose:

    Provides default initialization for objects.

Example:

public class Example { }

After compilation:

public class Example {
    public Example() { // Default constructor added by compiler
    }
}


Real-life example:

    Imagine you buy a blank notebook from the store.
    It has default pages, size, cover. You didn’t customize anything.
    That’s like a default constructor.

2️⃣ No-Argument Constructor (User-defined)

    What is it?
    Written manually by the programmer.
    No parameters, looks similar to default constructor.

Purpose:

    Initialize non-static fields with default values defined by the user.

Example:

public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Student() { // No-Argument Constructor
        id = 0;
        name = null;
    }
}


Real-life example:

    Think of a factory making plain chairs.
    This time, you specify default color and size manually, instead of using the store default.
    That’s like a user-defined no-argument constructor.

3️⃣ Parameterized Constructor

What is it?

    Constructor that accepts parameters.
    Used to initialize objects with custom values during creation.

Purpose:

    Each object can have different properties immediately after creation.

Example:

public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Employee(int id, String name) { // Parameterized Constructor
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Raj"); // Object initialized with user values


Real-life example:

    You order a customized laptop.
    You choose RAM, storage, color.
    Each laptop can have different specifications → just like parameterized constructor.

Program Example: Dog Class

File 1: Dog.java

package com.blc;

public class Dog {
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private double height;
    private int age;

    public Dog(String name, String color, double height, int age) {
        super(); // optional
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.height = height;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Dog [name=" + name + ", color=" + color + ", height=" + height + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }
}


File 2: DogDemo.java

package com.elc;

import com.blc.Dog;

public class DogDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog tommy = new Dog("Tommy", "White", 2.5, 3);
        System.out.println(tommy);
    }
}


Explanation:

    Dog class uses a parameterized constructor.
    tommy object is created with custom values (name, color, height, age).
    toString() method prints all properties of the dog.

Real-life analogy:

    Imagine a dog breeder.
    You order a dog with specific name, color, height, and age.
    The breeder gives you a dog exactly as requested → just like a parameterized constructor.
