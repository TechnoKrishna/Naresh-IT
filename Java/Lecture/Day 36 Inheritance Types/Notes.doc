🧠 Types of Inheritance in Java

👉 Inheritance means one class (child) getting properties and methods from another class (parent).

Example:
If you (child) inherit your father’s property (parent), that’s inheritance!

1️⃣ Single Level Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
Only one class inherits another class (1 parent → 1 child).

A → B
🧩 Example:

Vehicle is parent class
Car is child class

Car inherits features (like engine) from Vehicle.

Real Life Example:
A Car is a Vehicle — it gets the ability to start, stop, etc., from Vehicle class.

2️⃣ Multi-Level Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
A class inherits from another class which is already a subclass.
(Parent → Child → Grandchild)

2️⃣ Multi-Level Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
A class inherits from another class which is already a subclass.
(Parent → Child → Grandchild)

A → B → C


🧩 Example:

Vehicle → Car → ElectricCar

Real Life Example:
Your Grandfather’s house (A) → goes to Father (B) → then to You (C).
That’s multi-level inheritance.

3️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
One parent class has multiple child classes.

        A
       / \
      B   C


🧩 Example:

Vehicle is parent

Car and Bike are children.

Real Life Example:
A Teacher teaches many Students — Teacher is the parent, students are children.

4️⃣ Multiple Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
A class inherits from two classes.

A     B
 \   /
   C


🧩 Example:
If class C tries to get features from both A and B.

⚠️ Not supported using classes in Java (because of ambiguity problem).

Real Life Example:
If two teachers teach you the same subject differently — confusion arises!
That’s why Java avoids it for classes.

5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance

📘 Meaning:
It’s a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

       A
       |
       B
      / \
     C   D


Real Life Example:
Your Grandfather gives something to your Father,
and then your father gives it to You and your Brother — combination of multi-level and hierarchical.

🧾 Extra Notes

Every class in Java indirectly inherits from the Object class.

Every class follows single-level inheritance by default.

💻 Program Example (Single Level Inheritance)
class Vehicle {
    protected int numberOfEngine = 1;

    public void startVehicle() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    protected String engineType = "Battery";

    public void carInfo() {
        System.out.println("Number of engine is: " + numberOfEngine);
        System.out.println("Engine Type is: " + engineType);
    }
}

public class InheritanceDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startVehicle();
        car.carInfo();
    }
}


Explanation in simple words:
Car gets all features of Vehicle, so it can use startVehicle() method without writing it again.

Real Life Example:
You got a “start button” feature from your father’s car model (inherited feature).

💻 Program Example (Multi-Level Inheritance)
class Parent {
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public void setData(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getY() { return y; }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public void showData() {
        System.out.println("x value is: " + getX());
        System.out.println("y value is: " + getY());
    }
}

public class InheritanceDemo2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        child.setData(100, 200);
        child.showData();
    }
}


Explanation:
Child class gets setData() and getX()/getY() methods from Parent.

Real Life Example:
A son can access all the properties (like house, money) given by his father.

❓ Can We Inherit Constructors in Subclasses?

Answer: ❌ No.
Constructors are not inherited because the constructor name must be same as class name.
Parent’s constructor has a different name than the child’s class.

Real Life Example:
You can inherit your father’s property, but not his birth date.
Similarly, a class can inherit data, not its constructor.

💻 Example
class A {
    public A() {
        System.out.println("A class Constructor");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public B() {
        System.out.println("B class Constructor");
    }
}

public class ConstructorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B b1 = new B();
    }
}


Output:

A class Constructor
B class Constructor


Explanation:
Whenever you create an object of B, first A’s constructor runs automatically,
then B’s constructor executes.

🔑 super Keyword in Java

📘 Meaning:
super is used to access parent class members (variables, methods, or constructor).

You can use super:

To access parent variable

To access parent method

To call parent constructor

Note: You can’t use super inside static methods.

Real Life Example:
If you call your father “Dad,” you’re accessing your parent directly — that’s what super does.

🧩 1) Access Super Class Variable (Variable Hiding)
class Employee {
    protected double salary = 700000;
}

class Developer extends Employee {
    protected double salary = 900000; // Variable Hiding

    public void getSalaryInfo() {
        System.out.println("Employee Salary is: " + super.salary);
        System.out.println("Developer Salary is: " + this.salary);
    }
}

public class VariableHiding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Developer developer = new Developer();
        developer.getSalaryInfo();
    }
}


Output:

Employee Salary is: 700000.0
Developer Salary is: 900000.0


Explanation:

super.salary → accesses parent class variable

this.salary → accesses child class variable

Real Life Example:
If your father earns ₹7 lakh and you earn ₹9 lakh — you can refer to both incomes separately.

🧱 Constructor Chaining Flow
class Object {
    public Object() {  // Step 3
    }
}

class Employee extends Object {
    Employee() {
        super();        // Step 2
    }
}

class Developer extends Employee {
    Developer() {
        super();        // Step 1
    }
}

Developer developer = new Developer();


Explanation:
When you create a Developer object —
first Object constructor runs, then Employee, then Developer.

Real Life Example:
When a baby is born (Developer), the grandparents (Object) and parents (Employee) already exist —
they are created first in the chain.

🧩 2) Access Super Class Method (Method Overriding)
class Alpha {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Alpha class show method");
    }
}

class Beta extends Alpha {
    public void show() {
        super.show();
        System.out.println("Beta class show method");
    }
}

public class MethodOverridingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Beta beta = new Beta();
        beta.show();
    }
}


Output:

Alpha class show method
Beta class show method


Explanation:

super.show() → calls parent’s method

then child’s method executes

Real Life Example:
If your father gives a speech (super.show())
and you continue after him with your own (child’s show()), both speeches are heard — one after another.

✅ Summary

| Usage of `super` | Purpose                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `super.variable` | Access parent variable  |
| `super.method()` | Call parent method      |
| `super()`        | Call parent constructor |
