🧠 Variable

A variable is a name given to a memory location that stores a single value at a time.
👉 Example: int a = 10;

If you want to store multiple values, you must use an array.

Drawback:

A normal variable can hold only one value at a time.

📦 Array

An array is a collection of elements (mostly of the same type) stored in continuous memory locations.

👉 Example: int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

Arrays are stored in heap memory (since they are objects in Java).

✨ Characteristics of Array

1 > Homogeneous – all elements have the same data type.

2 > Fixed Size – once created, the size of the array cannot change.

3 > Indexed-based – you can access elements using an index.
👉 Example: arr[0] gives first element.

4 > Stored in continuous memory – makes access faster.

5 > Stored in heap memory – array is an object.

6 > Default values – if created using new, uninitialized elements get default values (e.g., 0 for int).

7 > Easy to retrieve – can easily get any element using index.

⚠️ Drawbacks of Array

1 > Fixed in size (can’t grow or shrink).
2 > Inserting or deleting in middle is slow (O(n)).
3 > No built-in methods for adding/removing elements.


🧩 Types of Arrays

1 > Primitive Type Arrays – store primitive data types.
👉 Example: int[], float[], char[], boolean[], etc.


2 > Reference Type Arrays – store objects or references.
👉 Example: arrays of class, abstract class, interface, or Object type.
(These are used more in polymorphism, discussed later.)
