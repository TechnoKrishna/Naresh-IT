🧩 Types of Array

1D Array (One-Dimensional Array)
2D Array / Multidimensional Array / Jagged Array

📘 1D Array

A 1D array is a simple list of elements (same or different type) stored in continuous memory locations.

Think of it as a single row of boxes, each box holding one value.

👉 Example:

int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


🛠️ Ways to Create Array Objects


1 > Using new keyword

👉 Example:

    int arr[] = new int[5];   // creates array of size 5

2 > Using literal array (with values)

👉 Example:

    int arr[] = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
    (Combination of new + values)

3 > Using anonymous array

👉 Example

    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    (Simpler and most commonly used)

🧠 Note

When you create an array, JVM internally creates a class to represent that array (based on its type, called a type signature).

Example: For int[], JVM internally gives a name like [I.


💡 In Simple Words

A 1D array is like a train with many compartments (elements) of the same type.

You can create it in three ways — using new, using values directly, or anonymous array.
