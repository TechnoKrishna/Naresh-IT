Q ) Flavors of Java

a) Java SE (Java Standard Edition) Standalone/Desktop Apps

    Core Java

b) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) Web & Enterprise Apps

    Advanced Java

c) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)    Mobile & Embedded Devices

    Android Java

d) JavaFX (Java FX)  Rich Internet Apps (UI/Graphics)

    JAVA FX (Out dated, By Using java FX we can develop GUI applications like button, radio button and so on)

Project Name: Green Project

Why Java?: Named after Java Island (Indonesia, famous for coffee)

Q ) What is a function ?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, can be reused, and usually takes input (parameters) and may return output (value).

Example (in Java):

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;   // returns sum
}

A function is divided into two types :

 1) Predefined OR Built-in function

    Predefined / Built-in Function
    Already provided by the programming language.
    Can be used directly without writing their code.

    Example in Java:

    Math.sqrt(25) → gives square root.
    System.out.println() → prints output.

 2) User-defined OR Custom function
    
    Created by the programmer to perform specific tasks.

    Example in Java:

    int square(int n) {
    return n * n;
    }

Q ) Advantages of Function

Reusability → Write once, use multiple times.

Modularity → Breaks program into smaller parts (easy to manage).

Readability → Code becomes cleaner and easier to understand.

Debugging → Easier to find and fix errors in smaller blocks.

Maintenance → Updating code is simpler when functions are used.

Reduced Redundancy → Avoids writing the same code again and again.
