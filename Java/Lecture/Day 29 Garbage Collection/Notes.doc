🧠 Basic Idea:

In Java, Garbage Collector (GC) automatically deletes objects that no longer have any reference pointing to them.
Think of it like removing unused items from memory to save space.

💡 There are 3 ways to make an object eligible for Garbage Collection:

1️⃣ Assigning null to a reference variable

Employee emp = new Employee(111, "Scott");
emp = null;

🪄 Explanation:

emp was pointing to the Employee object in memory (say address 1000x).
After we write emp = null;, it no longer points to that object.
So the object at 1000x is now unreachable → eligible for GC.

🏠 Real-life example:

Imagine you had a friend’s phone number saved in your contact list.
If you delete that contact, you can’t reach your friend anymore (but the friend still exists).
Similarly, the object still exists in memory, but since no one points to it, it can be cleaned by GC.

2️⃣ Creating an object inside a method

public void createObject() {
    Employee e2 = new Employee();
}

🪄 Explanation:

e2 is a local variable — it lives only while the method runs.
When the method ends, the stack frame is deleted, and e2 disappears.
Now, the Employee object e2 was pointing to becomes unreachable → eligible for GC.

🏠 Real-life example:
Think of borrowing a pen inside a meeting.
When the meeting ends, you return the pen, and your reference to it is gone.
Now no one in that meeting has it — it can be cleaned up (GC can remove it).

3️⃣ Assigning a new object to the same reference

Product p1 = new Product(999, "Camera");
p1 = new Product(333, "Mobile");

🪄 Explanation:

First, p1 points to the “Camera” object (say memory 3000x).
Then we assign it a new object “Mobile” (memory 4000x).
Now no one points to the “Camera” object → eligible for GC.

🏠 Real-life example:
You first buy a camera, then sell it and buy a mobile.
Now you don’t own the camera anymore → it’s like GC can remove it from your list of belongings.

🧩 Memory in Java

1) Method Area OR Class Area

All the static fields and static members are available in the Method Area.
Static data (class-level variables)

Example : Company rules shared by all employees

2) HEAP Area

All the non-static fields and non-static methods are available in the HEAP Area.
Objects (non-static data)

Example : Each employee’s personal data

3) STACK Area

All the local and parameter variables are available in the Stack Area.
Local variables and method calls

Example : Temporary work notes while doing a task

All these variables are stored in the Stack Frame.
Once method execution is over, the Stack Frame is deleted, and automatically the local and parameter variables are also deleted.

Whether it is a static or non-static method, methods are always executed from the STACK Area.

🪄 When a method finishes running, its stack memory is cleared — but heap memory objects stay until GC removes them.

class Customer {
    private String name;
    private int id;

    public Customer(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) { this.id = id; }
    public int getId() { return this.id; }
}

public class CustomerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int val = 100;
        Customer c = new Customer("Ravi", 2);
        m1(c);
        System.out.println(c.getId());
    }

    public static void m1(Customer cust) {
        cust.setId(5);
        cust = new Customer("Rahul", 7);
        cust.setId(9);
        System.out.println(cust.getId());
    }
}


🪄 Step-by-Step Explanation:

1 > In main(),
    Customer c = new Customer("Ravi", 2);
    → creates a Customer object (say memory 1000x) with id = 2, name = Ravi.

2 > Then we call m1(c);
    → The reference cust (inside m1) points to the same object (1000x).

3 > Inside m1:
    cust.setId(5); → changes id of same object (now id = 5).
    So both cust and c point to same Customer (id=5).

4 > Then we do:
    cust = new Customer("Rahul", 7);
    → now cust points to a new object (say 3000x).
    The old one (1000x) is still pointed by c, so it’s safe.

5 > cust.setId(9); → modifies the new object (Rahul, id=9).

6 > System.out.println(cust.getId()); → prints 9 (Rahul’s id).

7 > When m1() ends, cust (the local variable) is deleted.
    The object Rahul (3000x) now has no reference → eligible for GC.

8 > Back in main(), c.getId() prints 5 (Ravi’s id).


✅ Final Output:
                    9
                    5
