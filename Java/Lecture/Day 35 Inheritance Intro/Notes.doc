💡 Relationship Between Classes in Java

    In Java, relationships between classes can be of two main types:


1️⃣ IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)

➡️ Achieved using the Inheritance concept.

Example

class Vehicle {  
}

class Car extends Vehicle {  // IS-A Relation
}

📘 Meaning:

    The Car is a Vehicle.
    This represents a parent-child (superclass–subclass) relationship.
    So, Car can use all properties of Vehicle (like wheels, engine, etc.).


2️⃣ HAS-A Relationship (Composition / Aggregation)

➡️ Achieved using Composition or Aggregation concept.

Example

class Engine {  
}

class Car {  
    private Engine engine;  // HAS-A Relation
}

📘 Meaning:

One class contains another class inside it.

    The Car has an Engine.
    This represents a “part-of” or containment relationship.
    If you open the car, you’ll find an engine inside it.
    This means the Car object holds an Engine object inside it.
    So, a Car can’t run without its Engine — that’s why this relation is called HAS-A.


🔁 Inheritance: Code Reusability + IS-A Relation
Without Inheritance (Code Duplication Problem)

Example:

public class Developer1 {
    public void doSum(int x, int y) { }
    public void doSub(int x, int y) { }
}

public class Developer2 {
    public void doSum(int x, int y) { }
    public void doSub(int x, int y) { }
    public void doMul(int x, int y) { }
    public void doDiv(int x, int y) { }
}

🧩 Why Do We Use Inheritance?

When two classes have common code, we don’t want to write it again and again.

❌ Problem: Code duplication
✅ OOP Principle: Always reuse existing code rather than recreating it.

With Inheritance (Code Reuse)

public class Developer1 {
    public void doSum(int x, int y) { }
    public void doSub(int x, int y) { }
}

public class Developer2 extends Developer1 {
    public void doMul(int x, int y) { }
    public void doDiv(int x, int y) { }
}

✅ Now, Developer2 can reuse the doSum() and doSub() methods from Developer1.


Real-Life Example of Inheritance:

Think about a school 🎓

    Teacher is a general class (can teach, has name, etc.)
    MathTeacher extends Teacher (can teach + knows mathematics)
    ScienceTeacher extends Teacher (can teach + knows science)

All teachers have the same basic things, so we keep common code in the Teacher class and let others inherit it.

📘 What is Inheritance?

Definition:

    Deriving a new class (subclass) from an existing class (superclass) so that the new class acquires all the properties and behaviors (except private members) of the existing class.

    Simple Definition

    Inheritance means one class can use the properties and behavior of another class.

    This helps in reusing code and avoids writing the same code again.

    Key Points:

    Inheritance is an important feature of OOP that provides code reusability.

    Relationship:
        Parent Class → Superclass
        Child Class → Subclass

    Implemented using the extends keyword.

    Example

    class Developer2 extends Developer1 {
       // Developer2 inherits all non-private members of Developer1
    }

🧬 Characteristics of Inheritance

    All features of the superclass are automatically available in the subclass.
    Subclass doesn’t need to start coding from scratch.

    Creates a tightly coupled (IS-A) relation — changes in the parent affect the child.

    Represents a hierarchical classification:

        Moving upward → more general properties.
        Moving downward → more specific properties.

📎 Important Note

    By default, java.lang.Object is the superclass of all classes in Java.

Example

class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}

Now,

Dog d = new Dog();
d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
d.bark();  // defined in Dog

Output:

Eating...
Barking...

📘 Dog can do both because it inherits from Animal.

🧩 Types of Inheritance in Java

| Type                 | Description                               | Supported by Classes              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Single Level** | One class inherits another.               | ✅ Supported                       |
| 2️⃣ **Multi-Level**  | Chain of inheritance (A → B → C).         | ✅ Supported                       |
| 3️⃣ **Hierarchical** | Multiple classes inherit one superclass.  | ✅ Supported                       |
| 4️⃣ **Multiple**     | One class inherits from multiple classes. | ❌ Not Supported (ambiguity issue) |
| 5️⃣ **Hybrid**       | Combination of two or more types.         | ⚙️ Achieved using interfaces      |
