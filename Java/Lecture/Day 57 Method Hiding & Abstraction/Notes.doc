1. Method Hiding in Java

Question / IQ:

What is Method Hiding in Java?
Can we override a static method?
Can we override the main method?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:

Method Hiding occurs when a static method in a subclass has the same name and signature as a static method in the superclass.
Important: Static methods belong to class, not objects.
Hence: Static methods cannot be overridden. They can only be hidden.

Real-life Example:

Think of a school principal (class) who issues a general notice. If a department head (subclass) issues a notice with the same heading, it doesn’t replace the principal’s notice; it’s just a notice from that specific department. Similarly, static methods are tied to class, not individual objects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cases of Method Hiding

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 1: Calling Superclass Static Method

A public static method in a superclass is automatically available to its subclass.
The subclass can call this method directly.

class Super {
    public static void m1() {
        System.out.println("m1 static method of super class");
    }
}

class Sub extends Super {
}

public class MethodHidingDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sub sub = new Sub();
        sub.m1();
        System.out.println("...........");
        Sub.m1();
    }
}

Explanation:

The subclass Sub can access Super class static method m1() because static methods are inherited by default.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 2: Cannot Override Static with Non-Static

Static method belongs to class.
Non-static method belongs to object.
Trying to override a static method with a non-static method causes compile-time error.

class Super {
    public static void m1() {
        System.out.println("m1 static method of super class");
    }
}

class Sub extends Super {
    public void m1() { // Error: cannot override static method
        System.out.println("m1 non-static method of sub class");
    }
}

Real-life Example:

A company policy (static method) applies to all employees. An individual employee cannot make a personal rule (non-static method) that overrides the company policy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 3: Cannot Override Non-Static with Static

You cannot make a static method in subclass if the superclass method is non-static.
Causes compile-time error.

class Super {
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("m1 non-static method of super class");
    }
}

class Sub extends Super {
    public static void m1() { // Error: cannot override
        System.out.println("m1 static method of sub class");
    }
}

Conclusion:

Static ↔ Non-static overriding is not allowed.
Static methods belong to class.
Non-static methods belong to object.

Tip: Always remember: Object methods can’t override Class methods and vice versa.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 4: Method Hiding Only with Static Methods

Only static methods in superclass and subclass can hide each other.

class Super {
    public static void m1() {
        System.out.println("m1 static method of super class");
    }
}

class Sub extends Super {
    public static int m1() { // Method Hiding
        System.out.println("m1 static method of sub class");
        return 0;
    }
}

Key Points:

Method Hiding: static methods
Method Overriding: non-static methods

Real-life Example:

A company has a global notification system (static method in Super).

A department can send its own department-specific notification (static method in Sub) – this is method hiding, not overriding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 5: Static Method Hiding Behavior

Static methods cannot be overridden.

Writing a static method in the subclass with the same signature is method hiding, not overriding.

Compiler searches for superclass method; JVM executes method according to reference type.

class Bird {
    protected static double height = 2.2;
    public static void fly() {
        System.out.println("Generic Bird is flying");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
    protected static double height = 1.2;
    public static void fly() { // Method Hiding
        System.out.println("Parrot Bird is flying");
    }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird {
    protected static double height = 1.0;
    public static void fly() { // Method Hiding
        System.out.println("Sparrow Bird is flying");
    }
}

public class MethodHidingExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird bird = new Sparrow();
        System.out.println("Height is: " + bird.height);
        bird.fly();
    }
}

Notes:

@Override cannot be used for static methods.
Static methods behave the same for all objects → called Static Polymorphism.
A static or non-static field and static methods always execute according to current reference type.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Abstraction in Java

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:

Abstraction: Hiding complexity and showing only essential details.
Helps in simplifying the design and focusing on what a class does rather than how it does it.

Real-life Example:

Driving a car: you know how to drive (essential detail) without needing to understand the internal engine working (complexity).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Achieved using:

Abstract class and abstract method → partial abstraction (0–100%)
Interface → full abstraction (100%)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract Method vs Concrete Method

| Method Type     | Example                           | Description                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Concrete Method | `public void accept() { }`        | Instance / general method                       |
| Concrete Static | `public static void accept() { }` | Static method                                   |
| Abstract Method | `public abstract void accept();`  | No body, ends with `;`, uses `abstract` keyword |

Key Points:

Abstract methods do not have a body.
Concrete methods have implementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract Method Scenario

abstract class Vehicle {
    public abstract void run();
}

class Bus extends Vehicle {
    public void run() { }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void run() { }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    public void run() { }
}

Explanation:

Vehicle is abstract because the action run() is common but the implementation differs for each vehicle.

Real-life Example:

Think of Vehicle as a blueprint.
Bus, Car, Bike implement the blueprint differently: all can move (run()), but the way they move is different.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Points:

Use abstract method when action is common, but implementation differs.
If a class has at least one abstract method, it becomes an abstract class.
Cannot create objects of an abstract class.
Abstract methods of a superclass must be overridden in subclasses, otherwise the subclass also becomes abstract.

Extra Tips:

Abstract classes can have constructors, static methods, and fields.
They can also have concrete methods alongside abstract methods.
Interfaces (100% abstraction) are fully abstract, and a class can implement multiple interfaces for multiple inheritances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Summary:

Method Hiding: only for static methods, reference type decides behavior.
Abstraction: hides complexity, uses abstract classes or interfaces, object-specific implementation is done in subclasses.
Real-life examples help you remember the concept quickly.
