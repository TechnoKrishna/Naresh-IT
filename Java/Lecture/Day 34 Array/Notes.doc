🧠 Array in Java

🔹 What is a Variable?

A variable is like a box that can store only one value at a time.
It keeps data temporarily inside your computer’s RAM (Random Access Memory).

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Imagine you have one cup 🥤 — it can hold only one drink at a time (like tea or coffee).

If you want to keep multiple drinks, you’ll need more cups.
Similarly, a variable can store only one value.

✅ Why Do We Need Arrays?

If we want to store multiple values (like 10 student marks),
creating 10 separate variables is difficult:

int m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10;

Instead, we can use one array:

int[] marks = new int[10];

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Think of an egg tray 🥚.
Each small box (slot) can hold one egg, but the whole tray holds many eggs together.
That’s what an array does — it stores many values in one container.



⚙️ How Many Ways Can We Create an Array in Java?

There are 3 ways to create an array in Java:

1️⃣ Using new Keyword 

This method is used when we don’t know the values yet and want to take input later.

a) Primitive Type

int[] arr = new int[10];

📘 It creates an array with 10 empty boxes (each box can hold an integer).

Index starts from 0 and goes to 9 (total 10 elements).

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Think of 10 empty lockers in a school.
Each locker has a number (0 to 9) and can hold one student’s book.


b) Reference Type

We can also create an array to hold objects (not just numbers).

Student students[] = new Student[5];

This means: we have space for 5 Student objects.

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Imagine you have 5 parking slots 🚗🚙🚘 —
Each slot can later hold one car (Student object).
At first, they are empty (null), but later we can park (assign) cars.

💻 Example:

Student students[] = new Student[5];
students[0] = new Student(111, "Raj");
students[1] = new Student(222, "Ram");

📘 Here, we’re putting student details inside each slot of the array.

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Each parking slot now has a car with an owner’s name and ID.


🧩 Java VM Type Signatures
Type Signature	Java Type
Z	boolean
B	byte
C	char
S	short
I	int
J	long
F	float
D	double
L class;	fully-qualified-class
[ type	type[]
(arg-types) ret-type	method type

Fully Qualified Name = Package Name + Class Name

2️⃣ Inline Initialization

When we already know the values, we can directly store them while creating the array.

int arr[] = new int[]{10, 20, 30};

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

When you buy a box of chocolates 🍫, it already contains some chocolates inside —
You don’t have to fill it later.
Inline initialization is like buying a pre-filled box.

Example with Objects:

Dog dogs[] = new Dog[]{new Dog("A"), new Dog("B"), new Dog("C")};

📘 We are creating 3 Dog objects and storing them in an array immediately.

🧠 Notes

    While working with inline initialization, we have a few duplicates:
    1 > Size of the array is already known. 
    2 > Type of the array is already known.

Example:

int arr[] = new int[] {10, 20, 30};  // Duplicate info
✅ To avoid duplicates, we use Anonymous Arrays.

3️⃣ Anonymous Array

If we don’t want to repeat the type or don’t need to reuse the array later,
we can use anonymous array — a quick and short way.

int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};

Java automatically understands that it’s an integer array.

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Imagine ordering a combo meal 🍔🍟🥤 —
you don’t give individual names to items; you just take the combo as a whole.
That’s an anonymous array — simple and fast.

💻 Using Scanner Class

If you want to take array input from the user:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int size = sc.nextInt();
Player[] players = new Player[size];

Then use a for loop to fill data.

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Think of collecting player details for a cricket team 🏏.
You first ask: “How many players?” and then collect details for each one.


💻 Initializing Array Data Through Index

We can also assign data directly by index.

Book books[] = new Book[3];
books[0] = new Book();
books[0].title = "C";
books[0].author = "Denis";

🧍‍♂️ Real-life Example:

Like a library shelf 📚 with 3 sections —
Each section (index) has one book with title and author.

✅ Summary

| Way | Description           | Example                              |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣ | Using `new` keyword   | `int[] arr = new int[5];`            |
| 2️⃣ | Inline initialization | `int[] arr = new int[]{10, 20, 30};` |
| 3️⃣ | Anonymous array       | `int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};`          |


🌟 In Short:

Variable → One value
Array → Many values in sequence
File Handling → Permanent storage of data
